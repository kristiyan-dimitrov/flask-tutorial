!!! IMPORTANT !!!
Pytest uses fixtures by matching their function names with the names of arguments in the test functions. For example, the test_hello function youâ€™ll write next takes a client argument. 
Pytest matches that with the client fixture function, calls it, and passes the returned value to the test function.

For most of the views, a user needs to be logged in. The easiest way to do this in tests is to make a POST request to the login view with the client. 
Rather than writing that out every time, you can write a class with methods to do that, and use a fixture to pass it the client for each test.

In essence, this is like a dummy user, doing all the authentication actions that a real user would/could do.
